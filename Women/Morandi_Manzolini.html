            The institue of science in the <span class="place" data-place-id="2">Palazzo Poggi, Bologna,</span> houses a
            remarkable collection of wax anatomies created in the eighteenth
            century by artist-scientists renown for their work during their
            lifetimes but seldom considered by art historians today. Ercole
            Lelli, Giovanni Manzolini, and Anna Morandi Manzolini (1714-74),
            the subject of Rebecca Messbarger’s critical study and biography,
            were contemporaries, rivals, and partners in the art of making
            reproductions in wax of the human body and body parts for both the
            amazement of the public as well as medical instruction. This
            illuminating and thought-provoking account of Morandi’s life and
            work raises important questions for scholars of visual culture and
            encourages this reader to think more deeply about how artists
            learned about the human body, what eighteenth-century viewers saw
            when they looked at fine art, and the complex ways artist-partners
            worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luigi Crespi, an eighteenth-century biographer of Bolognese
            artists, established the narrative of Morandi’s career, and his
            account has been repeated by following writers, that is, until
            Messbarger. According to Crespi, Morandi was gifted but entirely
            dependent on her husband’s personal tutoring and professional
            success in his production of anatomical wax models. Morandi’s
            husband, Giovanni Manzolini, was fourteen years her senior and an
            established artist in Bologna when they married in 1740. It is

          </b></h6>
          <p>
            No surprise that this account of a female artist subservient to
            her husband and workshop master would be questioned today. Indeed,
            Morandi was twenty-six at the time of her marriage. While little
            is known about her life before her marriage, Morandi’s personal
            collection of Latin texts on anatomy and medicine; her own
            detailed writings based on her dissections of human cadavers, and
            her business skills on which she had to rely following the early
            death of her husband in 1755, which left her a single mother with
            two children to support; to say nothing of her artistic abilities,
            all suggest an education that was both humanist and practical. The
            more we learn about artists’ wives, the more we realize that male
            artists frequently sought marriages that were not only financially
            and socially rewarding, but were also partnerships in business if
            not in actual production. That Morandi so smoothly came to work at
            her husband’s side—literally at his side at the dissection
            table—further illuminates the practice of art production within
            families in the early modern period.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lack of information about Morandi’s early life allows
            Messbarger to build a context for the artist’s life and work in
            Bologna, a city that historically took great pride in its women
            scholars and artists. The picture that Messbarger creates for her
            readers of eighteenth-century Bologna is one of a city with a
            university depleted of its former excellence. She suggests that it
            was General Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, of a prominent Bolognese
            family, who breathed new life into Bologna’s scholarly communities
            in the early eighteenth century with his foundation of the
            Institute of Sciences, which united both the Academy of Sciences
            and the Clementina Academy of Art. The Institute not only brought
            together the sciences and the arts, it placed a renewed emphasis
            on “‘experiment, classification, and exposition’” (5). A
            generation later Morandi exemplified the new focus on the
            practical and experimental that Marsili had established as the
            core of the Institute’s philosophy. The Clementina, on the other
            hand, was a conservative society that continued the great
            Bolognese traditions of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth
            centuries established by the Carracci family. Ercole Lelli, the
            leading Bolognese anatomist at the time of Morandi’s rise to
            prominence, adhered to this conservative approach and saw his work
            as addressing the needs of artists looking for models. It is
            against that backdrop of an idealized art that Morandi can be seen
            infusing a methodical observation and scientific inquiry into her
            recreations in wax of the structure and systems of the human body.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps more important to Morandi than Marsili was the Bolognese
            nobleman Prospero Lambertini, the future Pope Benedict XIV. Before
            his rise to the papacy in 1740, Lambertini returned to Bologna in
            1730 as cardinal archbishop from his position as custodian of the
            Vatican Library. He supported Marsili’s plans for the Institute of
            Sciences and wanted to see Bologna once again a center of learning
            admired throughout Europe. For Lambertini it was medical science,
            particularly the study of anatomy, that set Bologna apart from
            other cities. He established the first chair of surgery at the
            Institute and authored several decrees advancing anatomical
            studies. Of particular relevance here was his reinterpretation of
            Pope Boniface VIII's Bull of 1299 that essentially prohibited the
            use of Christian bodies for dissection. Lambertini’s 1737 decree,
            “On the Anatomy to Be Done in Public Schools,” included a
            directive to Bolognese clergy to encourage their parishioners to
            donate bodies of deceased family members for the purpose of
            anatomical research. This offered the possibility of having
            cadavers of types of individuals seldom before examined by
            anatomists, who previously could only study the remains of
            condemned criminals. For Morandi and her husband a generation
            later, this decree assured a steady flow of material for their wax
            models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Critical to Lambertini’s plan for Bologna’s revival as the center
            for medical arts in Europe was the anatomy museum in the
            Institute, where life-size wax anatomical figures were to be
            displayed to the public. Ercole Lelli was commissioned by
            Lambertini to create these, including the life-size écorchés, or
            flayed human bodies made from wax, wood, and actual human bones,
            that showed the muscles and skeleton beneath the skin. The fully
            fleshed figures are presented as idealized bodies of Adam and Eve,
            with Adam gazing heavenward while Eve’s face is downcast in
            submission. The final male and female figures, full skeletons,
            were made from selected bones of numerous cadavers; they hold
            scythes that reinforce a narrative reading of Lelli’s work as a
            comment on the transitoriness of life. The museum’s purposes were
            several: to present the work of the Institute to the Bolognese
            public, to attract the attention of Italians and Europeans to
            Bologna’s medical accomplishments, and, for Lelli, to offer
            Bolognese artists an opportunity to study the human body in a
            manner that was far superior to standard studio practices. Lelli
            was assisted in his work by Manzolini, who resigned in 1746,
            claiming he had not received due credit for his skills and
            accomplishments. Shortly thereafter Manzolini together with his
            wife, Anna Morandi, opened a rival wax modeling studio and school
            of anatomy in their home, where medical students came for
            instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within their home studio and laboratory, Morandi and Manzolini
            dissected over a thousand cadavers, with Morandi presenting
            lectures during dissections to students and distinguished
            visitors. That Morandi, a woman, was so actively involved in
            dissection surprised many, as did her knowledge of the parts and
            systems of the human body. After her husband’s death, Morandi
            continued her scientific work, and her reputation spread with
            requests for commissions from throughout Europe as well as the
            Russian court of Catherine the Great.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morandi’s work was distinguished in significant ways from that of
            Lelli. Rather than seeing artists as a major audience, Morandi
            placed herself within the medical community of Bologna. In
            contrast to Lelli’s quasi-narrative figures, Morandi’s wax
            anatomies are stripped of narrative, allowing the viewer to be
            amazed at the work that is the human body itself. The grand poses
            and symbol-laden figures of Lelli seem both trite and overstated
            when the viewer comes face to face with what appears to be a
            mirror reflecting a part of ourselves we thought we knew but now
            realize we had never really seen. For example, Morandi’s studies
            of the eye appear on an octagonal blue ground that was hung before
            the viewer (Fig. 1). On this blue field—as if numbers on the face
            of a watch—are eight human eyes. Six of these are framed by a
            partial nose, brow, and upper cheek made of wax, then further
            framed by waxed cloth, making each eye appear to be peering out
            through a large keyhole. The viewer’s sensation that these eyes
            are staring is heightened by the fact that each is looking in a
            different direction. The other two eyes have no supporting flesh
            or bone; rather, we see what Morandi saw during dissection—the
            working eye supported by muscles, here taut against the blue
            surface of this mirror-like ground. These eyes, one gazing
            directly at the viewer, appear even more animated than the other
            six, in spite of their isolation from the human face. This is
            artistically an extraordinary composition, but after the initial
            shock of wonder subsides, the viewer realizes how accurate these
            eyes are, and how critical they must have been for medical
            instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Messbarger convincingly argues for Morandi’s place within
            Enlightenment science, and not, as Crespi and most later
            biographers suggested, merely as the dutiful wife of one of
            Bologna’s premier wax anatomists. Messbarger supports this claim
            through her analysis of Morandi’s extensive notes and letters, a
            careful examination of the wax models, and the writings of many
            contemporaries. Morandi was one of several women in
            eighteenth-century Bologna who engaged in scientific disputes. The
            areas of her expertise the developmental anatomy of the skeleton,
            the reproductive systems of men and women, as well as the sensory
            organs—were much debated at the time, and Morandi made corrections
            to erroneous ideas established in the medical community through
            her hands-on knowledge and observation from dissections.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than a biography, this rich narrative outlines the religious,
            political, cultural, and scientific life of eighteenth-century
            Italy, specifically Bologna. Rebecca Messbarger, associate
            professor in romance languages at Washington University in St.
            Louis, explores these contexts to suggest how a female
            artist-scientist could succeed in spite of the prejudices and
            sanctioned restrictions against a woman professional. Anna Morandi
            and her remarkable work—so beautifully illustrated in The Lady
            Anatomist—demands the attention of art historians and scientists
            of various research interests. There is much for us to learn here,
            not the least of which is the importance of these scholarly
            communities to one another, both historically and today.
