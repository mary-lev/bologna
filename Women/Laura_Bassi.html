            IN 1732 <span class="person" data-person-id="person_2"> LAURA BASSI </span>(1711-1778) became the second woman to receive
            a university degree and the first to be offered an official
            teaching position at any university in Europe. While many other
            women were known for their erudition, none received the
            institutional legitimation accorded Bassi, a graduate of and
            lecturer at the <span class="place" data-place-id="1"> University of Bologna </span> and a member of the Academy
            of the Institute for Sciences (Istituto delle Scienze), where she
            held the chair in experimental physics from 1776 until her death
            in 1778. In Germany she was held up as a model to encourage other
            learned women to receive formal recognition for their studies. In
            France she earned the praise of contributors to the article on
            "Woman" that appeared in the Encyclopedia; the Journal des
            Dames devoted an article to her accomplishments in March 1775.
            Bassi left behind little of her scientific work, but her
            correspondence amply testifies to her accomplishments in and
            centrality to the learned world. She evoked the admiration of
            Voltaire and Francesco Algarotti, corresponded with natural phi-
            losophers such as <span class="person" data-person-id="person_3"> Roger Boscovich </span>, Charles Bonnet, Jean Antoine
            Nollet, Giam- battista Beccaria, Paolo Frisi, and Alessandro

            pupils. As Voltaire wrote to her in 1744, "There is no

          <p>
            Bassi is one of the most interesting women natural philosophers of
            the early mod- em period.3 During her long tenure as a professor
            at the University of Bologna and the most prominent female member
            of Italy's leading scientific society, she played a central role
            in the introduction of new forms of learning into the university
            science curriculum and in the constitution of a network of
            experimenters that connected Italy to the scientific culture of
            France and England. Other women natural philosophers published
            more than she did-for example,<span class="person" data-person-id="person_4"> Margaret Cavendish </span>, Maria Sybilla
            Mer- ian, and Voltaire's celebrated companion, Emilie du
            Chatelet-but Bassi was best at inserting herself within the
            academic world of science. This essay explores the conditions that
            made her success possible. While considering the limitations that
            the social and institutional framework of science placed upon
            Bassi as a female prac- titioner in light of the cultural
            expectations of learned women in Enlightenment Italy, I also wish
            to indicate how Bassi used the patronage system and her unique
            role within it as both patron and emblem of the new science to
            carve a niche for herself in the scientific community of the
            eighteenth century.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bassi's activities began in the period that ushered in early
            discussions about New- ton, in the form of poems about the Opticks
            and cautious explorations of the Prin- cipia; by the time she died
            the general principles of Newtonianism had become a basis for
            explorations of all facets of the natural world. When Bassi first
            became associated with the University of Bologna, Newtonianism had
            only just begun to enter Italian academic discourse. Bassi studied
            primarily Aristotelian and Cartesian philosophy prior to receiving
            her degree, and she did not explore Newton's thought until the mid
            1730s, under the tutelage of the mathematician Gabriele Manfredi.
            She became one of the first scholars in Italy to teach Newtonian
            natural philosophy, beginning with her lectures on the less
            controversial Opticks in the late 1730s and continuing with the
            course in experimental physics that she conducted in her home and
            ultimately at the Institute. In 1749 she presented a dissertation
            on the problem of gravity and in 1763 one on refrangibility before
            her colleagues at the Institute; in 1757 she published a paper on
            hydraulics in the Commentaries of the Bolognese Institute and
            Academy for Sciences and Arts that worked out certain theorems
            posed by Newton. From the 1760s onward, in collaboration with her
            husband Giuseppe Veratti, she made Bologna a center for
            experimental research in electricity, attracting the interest of
            well-known scholars of this subject such as Abbe Nollet.4 Right
            until the end of her career, she made the dissemination of
            Newtonian ideas one of her principal goals. As late as 1774 she
            lectured on the work of Stephen Hales, well known for his
            applications of Newtonian ideas to explorations of fluids in works
            such as his Vegetable Staticks (1727).
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite Bassi's importance to the scientific culture of
            Enlightenment Italy, we know very little about her intellectual
            activities because so few of her dissertations and lectures have
            survived. In addition to the forty-nine theses printed for her
            doc- toral defense and various poems, Bassi published only four
            works in her lifetime: De acqua corpore naturali elemento aliorum
            corporum parte universi (1732), De aeris compressione (1745), De
            problemate quodam hydrometrico (1757), and De problemate quodam
            mechanico (1757). Another was published posthumously: De immixto
            fluidis aere (1792). These represent only a fraction of the
            dissertations that she prepared and defended annually at the
            Institute academy. And, as Alberto Elena observes, they tell us
            very little about Bassi's experimental and pedagogical activ-
            ities.5 Unlike Emilie du Chatelet, Bassi did not derive her fame
            from her publica- tions. In addition to the normal obstacles that
            faced women writers, she had to divide her time between teaching,
            experimenting, and raising a family of eight children (five of
            whom survived to adulthood).6 Equally important, Bassi did not
            need to publish to stake her claim within the community of natural
            philosophers. Instead, the unique opportunities that early modem
            Italian academic culture afforded Bassi made it possible for her
            to achieve recognition for her work in physics and mathe- matics
            through her actions rather than her pen. Her correspondence and
            contempo- rary reports of her activities allow us to follow her
            career as a natural philosopher in Enlightenment Italy.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the early eighteenth century science increasingly was a
            legitimate pursuit for exceptional women of unquestionable virtue.
            Women had become an audience for philosophical speculations, and
            their role as patrons and consumers of natural phi- losophy was
            increasingly acknowledged by contemporaries. The popularity of
            sci- entific activities in the Baroque Italian courts gave
            noblewomen the opportunity to observe and moderate the culture of
            experimentation and debate. In this context, women such as the
            grand duchess of Tuscany, Christina of Lorraine, and Queen
            Christina of Sweden emerged as patrons of science.7 The visibility
            of female patrons at court and the expansion of roles for women in
            the literary, artistic, and scientific academies of Italy set the
            background for the increased participation of socially prominent
            and intellectually gifted women in natural philosophy. Equally
            important were the possibilities that Cartesian philosophy
            offered. Descartes's famous dedication of his Principles of
            Philosophy (1644) to Elizabeth of Bohemia was seen by a number of
            scholars, male and female, as clear evidence that women were
            capable of philosophizing. Taking Descartes's praise of Elizabeth
            of Bohemia literally, Giu- seppa-Eleonora Barbapiccola translated
            the work into Italian in 1722 in order "to make it accessible to
            many others, particularly women, who, as the same Rene says in one
            of his letters, are more apt at philosophy than men."8 Bassi, in
            her studies of Cartesian philosophy in preparation for her thesis
            defense, may even have read Barbapiccola's translation. Certainly
            her family and mentors acted in accordance with these principles
            when they chose to make natural philosophy an important part of
            her education. Learned women had long been known for their skill
            in ancient languages and, in a city such as Bologna, law. Mastery
            of natural philosophy, partic- ularly the tenets of the new
            scientific learning, added a novel dimension to this topos.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the same period, Italian intellectuals explored the
            desirability of women's education. Most famously, the Accademia
            de' Ricovrati, known for its admission of women, conducted a
            series of debates in 1723 about whether "women should be allowed.
            to study Sciences and the Fine Arts" that expressed well the range
            of op ions of this issue.9 While many natural philosophers
            continued to oppose the entry of women into academic discourse,
            others, such as the president of the Accademia de' Ricovrati, the
            anatomist Antonio Vallisneri, encouraged their participation. Thus
            the Academy of the Institute for Sciences had important precedents
            to draw upon when it chose to add several women to its ranks,
            first among them Bassi. While claiming to imitate the new
            scientific societies such as the Royal Society, the Paris Academy
            of Sciences, and the Accademia del Cimento, none of which included
            women as members, the Institute academy nonetheless acknowledged
            its debt to the flourishing tradition of Italian academies that
            made the presence of women in their assemblies a necessary part of
            their composition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The presence of women within academic institutions in Italy stood
            in marked con- trast to the situation elsewhere. In countries like
            France women's participation oc- curred primarily in the salons.
            Excluded from the universities, women were allowed no role in
            organizations such as the Paris Academy of Sciences. As Francois
            Poulain de la Barre wrote in 1673, "They [men] founded Academies
            to which women were not invited; and in this way [women] were
            excluded from learning as they were from everything else." In
            contrast, the Italian academies welcomed French women of learning,
            capitalizing on the dearth of possibilities within French academic
            culture. Upon hearing of Emilie du Chatelet's admission to the
            Institute academy in 1746, one philosophe lamented:
          </p>
          <p>
            When Bologna proudly displays, in Italy, Its register adorned with
            the fair name of Emilie Why is the fair sex, so greatly loved by
            us, Excluded, in France, from the Academy?
          </p>
          <p>
            While other regions discarded the Renaissance model of the academy
            as a place in which learned men and women of high social standing
            could interact, Italian practice enhanced this image. Rather than
            creating a salon culture that served to formalize the separation
            of the world of the academies from the society of learned women,
            scholars in numerous Italian cities formed academies that linked
            the university, the salon, and the leisure activities of the urban
            patriciate. In Bologna, Bassi soon be- came the centerpiece of
            such a network. Her presence strengthened preexisting ties between
            different sectors of the political and cultural elite and
            contributed to the enhancement of the city's position within the
            Republic of Letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the academies and salons provided a setting in which men and
            women intermingled, enacting versions of the conversations
            fictionalized in works such as Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle's
            Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686) and Algarotti's
            Newtonianism for Ladies (1737), few women had access to the uni-
            versities in any capacity. Despite the fact that the University of
            Bologna celebrated a handful of women who had either attended or
            given lectures in the Studium during the Middle Ages, no woman in
            any part of Europe had been offered a degree before 1678 or an
            official teaching position before 1732. Most universities
            implicitly ex- cluded women from any form of participation and
            would continue to do so until the late nineteenth and twentieth
            centuries. Women's learning was represented as a sep- arate
            enterprise from the education of men. In the early seventeenth
            century, when the theologian Gisbert Voet allowed Anna Maria van
            Schurman to attend his lectures at the University of Utrecht, he
            maintained the tradition of having her listen behind a curtain in
            order to separate her from the male scholars."1 Bassi's
            integration into the university culture of Bologna upon the
            receipt of her degree marked a departure from these practices.
            Benefiting from earlier traditions, which permitted women oc-
            casional access to the classroom, Bassi nonetheless was
            distinguished by the per- manency of her position and by the fact
            that she performed many of the same func- tions as her male
            colleagues, as a salaried professor, lecturer, and experimenter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attention showered upon Bassi was the culmination of several
            abortive at- tempts to install a woman within the Italian
            university system. In 1678 over twenty thousand spectators crowded
            into Padua to see the Venetian noblewoman Elena Cor- naro Piscopia
            receive a degree in philosophy. Immediately afterward, the rectors
            of the University of Padua agreed to admit no more women; when
            Piscopia died in 1684, she was celebrated as the first and, for
            the time being, the last female graduate of that university. By
            the 1720s the leading citizens of Bologna had begun to conceive of
            the idea of having their own woman graduate. The city abounded
            with learned women such as Teresa and Maddelena Manfredi, sisters
            of Eustachio and Gabriele and their assistants in matters
            astronomical, or the bella cartesiana, Laura Bentivoglio Davia,
            who so disparaged "the noisy conferral of the doctorate" on Bassi
            However, the first attempt occurred in the domain of law rather
            than natural phi- losophy. In 1722, ten years before Bassi
            embarked on her career as a public intel- lectual figure, the
            Bolognese noblewoman Maria Vittoria Delfini Dosi defended sev-
            eral legal theses at the Spanish College. While subsequent
            attempts on the part of her father to convince the University of
            Bologna to grant her a degree in jurispru- dence failed, Delfini
            Dosi's public display of learning reopened the debate about the
            place of women in academic culture in Bologna. By the 1750s two
            women had received degrees-Bassi and Cristina Roccati-and
            three-Bassi, the mathemati- cian Maria Gaetana Agnesi, and the
            anatomist and wax modelist Anna Morandi Man- zolini-had been
            offered teaching positions. Bologna, as one critic complained, now
            had "a platoon of women teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this evaluation, Bassi was the only woman in the
            eighteenth century whose circumstances allowed her the opportunity
            to engage fully in the activities that her male counterparts took
            for granted. Situated in a climate in which the idea of a "career"
            as an experimental philosopher was only gradually beginning to
            emerge, she took advantage of the ambiguous parameters of the
            scientific community and of the veneration accorded learned women
            to extend the range of her responsibilities.14 In less than a
            century, the patronage that women offered to the sciences and
            their growing presence as spectators and members of various
            learned academies had opened the way to their participation. And
            Italy, more than any other region in Enlighten- ment Europe,
            offered learned women diverse circumstances in which to exercise
            and display their erudition.

          <h6>BASSI TAKES HER DEGREE</h6>
          <p>
            When Laura Bassi accepted the invitation to defend forty-nine
            theses in front of the notables of Bologna on 17 April 1732, and
            the subsequent offer of a position as a university lecturer, she
            entered a complex social world. The scientific culture of early
            modern Europe was constituted within a dense network of patrons,
            brokers, and clients whose shifting relationships forged the
            boundaries of the learned commwunity. " Aspiring natural phil
            without patrons than they could lay claim to the title of
            "philosopher" without having read Aristotle. Social connections in
            conjunction with learning made acceptance into the scientific
            community possible; they mediated the awarding of university
            positions and promotions and paved one's entry into the courts,
            salons, and academies, where knowledge was put on display in front
            of a largely patrician audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this system, women were perceived primarily as
            facilitators. Like Bal- dassar Castiglione's ideal female
            courtiers, their presence provided a necessary im- petus to
            conversation, but they spoke rarely, if at all. While early modern
            culture recognized, indeed encouraged, female patrons of science,
            it accommodated women who sought rather than dispensed patronage
            less easily. Bassi was precisely this sort of individual.
            Genuinely committed to teaching and research, she attempted to
            build a career out of her position by using the same patrons and
            institutions as her male counterparts. While always acknowledging
            her special status, she nonetheless re- fused to accept the
            limitations placed upon her. Like Madame du Chatelet, she con-
            tinued to profess astonishment at the fact that while women were
            accepted as rulers in several countries, "there is none in which
            we are elevated to think," and she devoted her life to making
            Bologna an environment in which at least one woman contradicted
            this general rule.'6
          </p>
          <p>
            The scientific climate of Bologna in 1732 was particularly
            conducive to public and institutional recognition of a learned
            woman, especially one versed in the latest mathematical and
            experimental philosophies. The final decades of the seventeenth
            century had witnessed a major decline in the international
            reputation of the University of Bologna, and even the efforts of
            committed reformers like Anton Felice Marsili to revitalize the
            curriculum had yielded disappointingly few results and little ac-
            knowledgment from the outside world. The founding of the Institute
            for Sciences by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili in 1714 institutionalized
            these reforms, establishing a teaching and research facility
            specifically designed to supplement the traditional curriculum,
            particularly in the experimental sciences.'7 Where late
            seventeenth-century acade- mies had failed, the Institute
            succceeded, bringing Bologna again to the attention of the learned
            world through its importation of the best ideas of the new
            philosophy to Italy. In 1728 the young Algarotti first replicated
            Newton's optical experiments before the Institute members, the
            beginning of his efforts to introduce Newtonianism into Italy.
            Best known for his Newtonianism for Ladies, completed at Cirey in
            the company of Voltaire and Chatelet, Algarotti was an active
            participant in the diffusion of Newtonianism in Italy. While we
            most often think of this work in relation to Chatelet's
            translation of Newton's Principia, we should not neglect
            Algarotti's ac- tivities preceding the trip to France. Algarotti
            included a portrait of Chatelet in the engraved frontispiece, but
            he made several references to Bassi in the text. Completed only
            four years after Bassi had defended several Newtonian theses in
            public, and five years after Algarotti had witnessed her degree
            ceremonies (about which he wrote several poems), Newtonianism for
            Ladies was as much a tribute to Bassi and the Institute as it was
            to the activities of the French philosophers.18
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Institute commenced with a great flourish, the death of
            its principal patron Marsili in 1730 and the lack of tangible
            results had diminished its public splendor. This intellectual
            torpitude was further exacerbated by the flagging fortunes of the
            Bolognese patriciate. By the 1720s the ranks of the major
            families-the Al- drovandi, Bentivoglio, Cospi, Paleotti, and
            Ranuzzi, to list a few-that had domi- nated the political culture
            of the city had thinned greatly.19 Their replacement by members of
            the minor nobility only furthered the perception that Bologna was
            no longer the splendid center it once had been. Thus the
            university, the academy, and the city needed Bassi as much as she
            needed them. Publicizing Bassi's accomplish- ments, and enhancing
            them beyond anything achieved by earlier learned women, would add
            luster to the reputation of Bologna.
          </p>
          <p>
            The daughter of a lawyer, Bassi received her early tutelage at
            home from Gaetano Tacconi, the family physician, a professor at
            the university, and a member of the Institute academy. As Bassi's
            accomplishments grew, pressure for her to appear in public
            mounted. Bassi was reputed to be a "monster in philosophy"; her
            fluency in Latin as well as Cartesian and Newtonian philosophy was
            noted by many contem- poraries, among them the poet Giampietro
            Zanotti, who proclaimed her Latin to be better than his Bolognese.
            For Bassi and most educated women in Italy, science was not an
            alternative to classical learning, as it often was advertised in
            France and En- gland, but its supplement; this provided the
            necessary element of continuity between Renaissance and
            Enlightenment views of learned women.20 In the early months of
            1732 Tacconi finally allowed a select group of professors and
            gentlemen, among them the secretary of the Institute, Francesco
            Maria Zanotti, and the new archbishop of Bologna, Prospero
            Lambertini, to hear Bassi dispute privately on various subjects.
            As news of her remarkable erudition spread, she "found herself
            constrained to make almost a continuous spectacle of herself in
            the City." Cardinal Lambertini soon per- suaded her to appear in
            public, and Tacconi and Zanotti proposed her election to the
            Institute academy, to which she was aggregated on 20 March 1732.
            Less than a month later, on 17 April, she engaged in a public
            dispute with five university pro- fessors, among them the
            physicist-chemist Jacopo Bartolomeo Beccari and Gabriele
            Manfredi.21
          </p>
          <p>
            From the moment that Bassi agreed to participate in the public
            debates, her social position shifted. No longer simply a woman
            whose learning made her an object of curiosity and a participant
            in the civil discourses of the urban patriciate, she had become
            the symbol of the scientific and cultural regeneration of the
            city. The con- ferral of a degree on 12 May and the Senate's
            decision to award her a university chair on 29 October 1732
            formalized the terms of the new relationship. Detailed reports of
            the defense, the degree ceremony, and her first lecture as a
            university professor illuminate the emergence of Bassi as a public
            figure. All these events were attended not only by the university
            faculty and students, but also by the principal political and
            religious figures of the city-the papal legate and vice-legate,
            the arch- bishop of Bologna, the gonfaloniere, the elders
            (Anziani), senators, and magistrates. Additionally, "all the
            Ladies of Bologna and all the Nobility," along with foreigners and
            curious onlookers, filled the rooms to hear her speak.22 The
            composition of the audience testified to the close ties between
            the academic, civic, and patrician life of the city and
            underscored Bassi's importance to all three domains. In her
            passage from private citizen to public ornament, Bassi had become
            an emblem of Bologna's efforts to regain its foothold in the
            learned world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contemporary descriptions and illustrations give us a fairly
            precise idea of the performative nature of these events. The
            defense and the degree ceremony occurred not in the Archiginnasio,
            home to the Studium, but in the Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the
            local and papal government.23 There, accompanied for decorum's
            sake by Count- ess Maria Bergonzi Ranuzzi and Marchesa Elisabetta
            Ercolani Ratta, two prominent noblewomen, Bassi engaged in her
            first public disputes. Arriving at the Palazzo Pubblico, Bassi
            went first to the quarters of the current gonfaloniere, Filippo
            Al- drovandi, where she was joined by the archbishop, the legate
            Girolamo Grimaldi, Cardinal Melchiorre de Polignac-a dignitary
            visiting Bologna on his way from Rome to Paris-and other
            "eminences." From these rooms she made her way to the Sala
            d'Ercole, where the degree was awarded by the chancellor of the
            Studium, Ales- sandro Formagliari, and the prior of the college,
            Matteo Bazzani. Both ceremonies ended with the retreat of the
            young "philosophess" (filosofessa) to the gonfaloniere's quarters
            within the Palazzo Pubblico, where she was privately feted,
            accompanied by "all the Ladies." In between her arrival and
            departure, Bassi traversed the space separating her podium from
            the canopied throne (baldacchino) on which Archbishop Lambertini
            and Cardinal de Polignac were seated in order to pay her respects
            and receive their compliments .24
          </p>
          <p>
            In an oration written especially for the degree ceremony, Matteo
            Bazzani praised Bassi for displaying her talents "in the most
            prosperous civic theater." Drawing at- tention to the long
            heritage of learned women associated with the University of Bo-
            logna, he presented Bassi as the culmination of a tradition that
            stretched back to the early days of the university in the later
            Middle Ages. As Bassi's colleague at the Institute, Beccari, was
            later to write to Maria Gaetana Agnesi when she was offered an
            honorary position at the university in 1750, "From the most
            ancient times Bologna has had people of your sex [lecture] from
            the public chairs."25 Thus Bassi was invited to enhance and
            reconstitute this tradition in 1732. Her skills in ancient
            languages as well as modern sciences made her eminently qualified
            to fulfill her role.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Bazzani, Bassi was extremely conscious of her audience and
            its expectations. In the opening of her thesis defense she
            acknowledged frequently the presence of all the principal parties
            who had made the dispute possible. More pointedly, in the course
            of her first public lecture after the conferral of a university
            chair, on 18 De- cember 1732, Bassi made particular reference to
            the governing body as patron of her efforts: "the magnanimity of
            the Senate raised me, beyond what I asked for and dreamed of, to
            the highest dignity of speaking in public," she proclaimed. The
            active role of the Senate in facilitating Bassi's position was
            confirmed by her biographer Giovanni Fantuzzi, who described it as
            "a spectator up until this [moment]," inter- vening with the offer
            of a position to prevent her from lapsing into "leisure and
            mediocrity" only after witnessing the success of her defense.26
            While her tutor Tac- coni and his circle of friends, among them
            the influential Lambertini and Zanotti, had first brought this
            remarkable woman to the attention of Bologna, the Senate, as the
            body that governed all university appointments, gave her an
            official position.
          </p>
          <h6>MISPLACED EXPECTATIONS?</h6>
          <p>
            While offering Bassi a permanent role in the academic culture of
            the city, the Senate initially defined her duties as a lecturer
            restrictively. As one 1778 eulogy to Bassi described it, they
            "wished to inscribe her in the roll of Professors of Philosophy
            without the burden of exercising this commitment." During the
            deliberations about her position, beginning on 25 August and
            concluding on 29 October 1732, the Senate voted to award Bassi an
            annual stipend of 100 scudi "on the condition, however, that she
            should not read in the public schools except on those occasions
            when her Superiors commanded her, because of [her] Sex." The dates
            for these lectures were to be determined jointly by the papal
            legate and the gonfaloniere. Less than a year later, the governing
            board of the university (Assunti di Studio) recommended to the
            city government (Reggimento) that Bassi give one lecture "every
            Trimester."27 Quite likely they imagined that she would speak at
            fall convocation, at the public anatomy (usually held in early
            February), and at the conclusion of the academic year in June.
            Thus the appearance of the local celebrity marked the rhythm of
            the academic year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nature of the events, both public and private, at which Bassi
            was invited to appear illustrates well the expectations her
            patrons had of her. Within days of the degree ceremony, Bassi
            entertained the visiting Cardinal de Polignac by disputing with
            four doctors from the university. On 15 June 1733 she participated
            in a public debate with Giuseppe Azzoguidi on "Poisons and Their
            Antidotes." From 1734 until 1778 she appeared annually as one of
            the disputants at the famed carnival anatomy and participated in
            105 public disputes formally mandated by the university. From 1746
            until 1777 she presented one formal dissertation yearly at the
            Institute academy as part of her responsibilities as a member of
            its elite core, the Benedictines (Be- nedettini). Many of these
            coincided with "the occasion of the Public Academies," held
            periodically by the Institute, to which nonmembers could come.28
            This pattern of activity, dictated by the institutional calendar,
            was occasionally punctuated by singular events, command
            performances at the request of patrons. For example, the arrival
            of a new legate in 1734 and the election of Carlo Grassi in 1745
            were note- worthy enough to demand Bassi's presence. Similarly,
            the awarding of a degree to Cristina Roccati in 1751 and the
            fortieth anniversary of the Institute in 1754 required her
            participation. Had Maria Gaetana Agnesi chosen to come to Bologna
            to accept her honorary chair in mathematics in 1750, she certainly
            would have engaged in a public dispute with Bassi; this was surely
            one of the reasons why Benedict XIV and the members of the
            Institute were so keen on affiliating Agnesi with the scientific
            institutions of Bologna. Undoubtedly they were disappointed when
            the opportunity to pit the two most famous women natural
            philosophers in Italy against each other did not come to pass.29
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to her participation in various ceremonies, Bassi
            attended important social gatherings for the nobility. "All the
            gentlemen of Bologna make a great dis- play of this girl, and
            depict her everywhere as the miracle of our age," wrote Gio- vanni
            Bianchi from Rimini in 1732. Friends such as the noblewoman
            Elisabetta Ratta had informal literary gatherings at their homes,
            to which Bassi was invited. Her close association with local poets
            like the Zanotti brothers made her sought after for her eloquence
            as well as her learning. Patrons like Senator Filippo Aldrovandi,
            gonfa- loniere when Bassi received her degree, hosted
            well-publicized "Sunday evenings" for the Bolognese patriciate. As
            the Avvisi di Bologna reported in 1736, on one such evening in
            November Bassi debated both Matteo Bazzani and Francesco Maria Za-
            notti, alternately in Italian and Latin, in front of "all the
            Nobility in formal attire," including "over 120 Ladies." Appearing
            at the conclusion of the "noble Symphonies in diverse parts of the
            Palace," Bassi received the "universal applause" of the Bo-
            lognese elite as well as the "many Foreign Nobles" present.30
            Despite Bassi's initial reticence about appearing in public, after
            receiving her degree she was quickly in- tegrated into the social
            circuit of the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most revealing, however, was the frequency of her appearance at
            the carnival anatomy. The anatomy was a central feature of the
            public life of the university; like Bassi's degree ceremony, it
            enhanced the ritual life of the city. Unlike Bassi's degree
            ceremony, it was performed annually-the one dissection during the
            year that was open to anyone able to buy tickets. While other
            professors rotated in and out of the lectureships assigned to the
            public dissection, Bassi's presence was essential to the success
            of this popular event. Lasting ten to fifteen days, the annual
            dissection, held before Lent, entailed an elaborate ceremonial in
            which the leading professors, sen- ators, and dignitaries of the
            town participated. Formal invitations were sent to prom- inent
            members of the community and important foreigners.3' In addition,
            a riotous crowd of carnival revelers filled the anatomy theater
            with shouts and jeers as they watched the local intellectuals try
            to acquit themselves on any subject deemed worthy of conversation,
            as well as the proposed topic of the anatomy. The fortunes of the
            carnival anatomy curiously paralleled Bassi's own. Revived just
            when the univer- sity's reputation had reached its nadir, the
            anatomy was perceived as both an "honor to the Studium" and an
            "attraction to foreign scholars."32 Given its significance,
            Bassi's presence was imperative in the eyes of the Senate, once
            her position made such public performances possible.

            Her first appearance in this setting occurred on 23 February 1734
            (see Figure 1). Domenico Gusmano Galeazzi presented a dissertation
            on sight, De visu. The new legate, Giovanni Battista Spinola, had
            arrived in the city shortly after New Year's. Accompanied by the
            gonfaloniere and the Anziani, Spinola attended the first and last
            lectures and the one at which Bassi debated Galeazzi: "With most
            subtle and learned arguments and rare expositions of experiments
            regarding the Sense of Sight, she demonstrated a high and profound
            understanding of this material, rousing widespread applause from
            the large Audience, most especially from the most Excellent signor
            Cardinal Legate, who understood for the first time the great
            Virtue and Knowledge of the lauded Dottoressa." What the official
            acts of the governing body of the uni- versity did not mention,
            however, were the "many Foreigners and a great many Maskers
            present."33 While the content of her disputes may have appealed
            chiefly to a small learned constituency able to follow the
            intricacies of academic Latin, among them the legate and the
            archbishop, her presence at the anatomy only heightened the

          perception of the event as the epitome of the world tumed upside
          down. For the infinity of Foreigners and People" who crowded into
          the theater on the second floor of the Archiginnasio, only in the
          carnival setting of the public anatomy could a woman truly shake
          off the weight of custom and become learned. Just as members of
          the audience, in the spirit of carnival, cloaked their true
          identities by wearing masks, Bassi too "disguised" herself with
          her knowledge. The organizers of the public anatomy manipulated
          this tradition to their advantage, linking the 'virtue" of Bassi's
          presence in the Studium with the "honor" of the carnival
          festivities.34 Since this was the one time during the year when
          the general public could see an anatomical dissection and Europe's
          only female professor, it was a rare occasion indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Senate's decision to restrict Bassi's public appearances to
            ceremonial occa- sions, ratione sexu, matched well the cultural
            image of Bassi developed by her ad- mirers in the first years of
            her lectureship. Returning to the degree ceremony itself, we can
            see the crafting of an image at work. Despite reports that Bazzani
            "awarded her a degree according to the usual forms," the ceremony
            diverged in several im- portant ways. Bassi received her degree
            gratis, without any of the presents, pay- ments, and banquets that
            graduates customarily gave their professors and patrons. Rather
            than giving gifts, as tradition dictated, she was herself the
            recipient of lavish presents: the silver, jewel-encrusted crown of
            laurels-a gift of the Countess Ra- nuzzi that replaced the
            traditional beret of male graduates, the medal struck for the
            occasion (see Figure 2), and the poems written in her honor.

          silver laurels upon her head, compared her transfigurati Ovid's

          </p>
          <p>
            Other gifts, while part of the customary degree ceremony, took on
            added sign icance. Along with the crown of laurels, Bassi also
            received a ring and an ermine cape. Placed on her "connubial
            finger" by the prior Bazzani, the ring signified not simply her
            membership in the academic community but her virtual "marriage" to
            the city and the Studium. Writing to Algarotti, Elisabetta Ratta
            described "the most vigorous praise of our Beccari towards the
            young scholar, who never finished without saying: egregie, virgo
            sapientissima, egregie" during the thesis defense .3 Recalling
            both the religious tradition of women in orders as brides of
            Christ and the civic tradition of virgins whose chastity cemented
            the foundations of republican govern- ment, Bassi, as a "most
            learned virgin," found herself fulfilling these ancient topoi.
            Given the continued strength of such bonds, even in the eighteenth
            century, the murmurings against Bassi's decision to marry Giovanni
            Giuseppe Veratti in February 1738 were quite understandable. "Thus
            you would blemish your glory? [Dedisti ma- culam in gloria tua?],"
            accused one anonymous pamphleteer.37
          </p>
          <p>
            The association between female learning, virtue, and sanctity was
            still strong in the eighteenth century, though not as pervasive as
            it had been in the fourteenth through the seventeenth centuries.
            But learning and virginity did not only suggest sanctity. They
            also imbued a woman with the qualities of Minerva. Numerous
            elogies pre- sented Piscopia as the "Venetian Minerva," and
            Voltaire described Chatelet in sim- ilar terms. Under the portrait
            commissioned by the Accademia degli Infecondi of Rome on the death
            of Piscopia in 1686, the inscription read, "Surely you believe the
            image which you see to be Minerva? [Quam cernis pictam ne credas
            esse Mi- nervam?].,38 Bassi, the "marvel of her sex and an
            ornament of our Patria," fulfilled a similar role in the eyes of
            her admirers. As the inscription on the obverse of the medal
            commemorating her degree declared: "Soli cuifas est videsse
            Minervam" (see Figure 2). Contemporaries must have associated this
            vision of Bassi with the frequent appearance of Minerva in the
            allegorical imagery of the Studium and the Institute.39 Casting
            her light across the city, Bassi illuminated the path to wisdom,
            so recently obscured, permitting the citizens of Bologna once
            again to "see Minerva."
          </p>
          <p>
            Described variously by contemporaries as the "new light of
            philosophy," the "lu- minous mirror of Science," and the "alumna
            of the Muses," Bassi became the em- blem of scientia in all its
            forms. Compared to the sixteenth-century poetess Vittoria Colonna
            and most frequently to Petrarch's Laura, whom she surpassed by
            combining a learning and eloquence equal to Petrarch's with
            womanly grace, Bassi was the quintessential Enlightenment Muse
            (see Frontispiece).40 With this designation came a variety of
            social burdens. Not only the subject of numerous poems, among them
            Algarotti's famous "Non la lesboa," Bassi also was expected to
            write poetry for important public functions. In 1737 she
            contributed to a volume of poems, collected by Giampietro Zanotti,
            for the wedding of Carlo Emanuele, King of Sardinia, and Elizabeth
            of Lorraine; the same year she repaid Maria Ranuzzi's gift of the
            silver crown of laurels (laurea d'argento) by writing poems for
            the wedding of the count- ess's niece. Even as late as 1744, when
            Gian Lodovico Bianconi wrote to Giuseppe Veratti in gathering
            information on Bassi for his book of contemporary authors, he was
            more interested in the number of "poetic Academies" to which she
            had been admitted than in her scientific activities.41
          </p>
          <p>
            While Bassi welcomed the opportunity to display her talents in a
            public forum, she was increasingly uncomfortable with her literary
            apotheosis. Letters such as the one written by the learned
            Francesca Manzoni in 1737-"you fly so high, where I do not dare
            address my thoughts," effused the Milanese poetess-must have only
            reinforced her desire to carve an image for herself removed from
            these laudations. By February 1737 she was complaining to Zanotti
            that she had no desire "to compose poetry ever again," and she
            resumed with vigor her attempts to get the Senate to expand her
            pedagogical duties.42 By a somewhat different path than Chatelet,
            whose interest in mathematics was nurtured in the salon culture of
            Paris and through her association and correspondence with various
            philosophes, Bassi too had discovered natural philosophy as her
            vocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The late 1730s were, in many respects, crucial years for the
            formation of Bassi's career. Recently married and firmly
            established as an arbiter of learning in the city, Bassi, with the
            help of her husband, friends, and patrons, began to test the
            limits of her authority. In 1738, frustrated at the restrictions
            placed upon her teaching, she initiated a series of private
            lessons at home in the tradition of many university pro- fessors.
            Soon she found herself managing a lively scientific salon.
            Arriving in Bo- logna only a year later, Charles de Brosses
            described the balance of Bassi's private activities and public
            duties: "Indeed she wears the gown and ermine cape when she gives
            public lectures; this happens rarely and only on certain festival
            days, because it was not considered decent for a woman to show the
            hidden things of nature to all-comers daily. In recompense,
            philosophical conferences are held at her house from time to
            time." Initially intended for university students, the private
            lessons soon were attended exclusively by "nobles as well as
            scholars," and her fame as a teacher and orator grew. 43
          </p>
          <p>
            One year later, following the procedure used by other professors,
            Bassi submitted a request for a salary increase to the university;
            at the same time she petitioned for a reconsideration of the
            parameters of her duties. As the letter presented to the As- sunti
            di Studio on her behalf explained: "She has sustained many
            disputes in the presence of Cardinals, Princes and other
            noteworthy subjects and continually re- ceives Foreigners in her
            house with the obligation to respond to the Questions put to her
            and to hold literary discourses at their pleasure, often entailing
            formal disputes in her House on such occasions with the
            intervention of many Gentlemen and Schol- ars." This was in
            addition to her mathematical studies with Gabriele Manfredi and
            the teaching of a "Course in the Experiments of Newton regarding
            light and color." In two separate meetings held that December,
            Bassi was granted an increase of 160 lire and the restrictions
            placed upon her public teaching were substantially reduced.44
          </p>
          <p>
            Possibly the modifications in the Senate's policy toward Bassi in
            1739 were a reflection of the 1737 reform of the university that
            paved the way for the introduction of the experimental sciences in
            the curriculum. Bassi's colleague Beccari accepted the first
            university chair in chemistry as a result of this
            reorganization.45 More likely, however, they testified to the
            growing strength of her connections in the Senate, where
            supporters like Aldrovandi rallied to her cause. Less than a
            decade after her installation as a "celebrated woman," Bassi's
            presence had achieved what her patrons hoped it would do: more
            foreigners were coming to Bologna, and the visibility, if not
            exactly the reputation, of the Studium had risen accordingly. As
            one of her biographers put it, "no scholar would pass through
            Bologna without being eager for her learned conversation."
            Contemporaries delighted in knowing about the "visitors of
            consequence" like Joseph II or the son of the Polish king who
            graced her philo- sophical conferences.46 By acceding to the
            demands placed upon her by various pa- trons, Bassi eventually
            found herself in a position of strength, for she could expect some
            degree of reciprocation. This took the form of concessions to her
            desire to participate more actively in the culture of the Studium
            and the allocation of money to support the costly equipment and
            materials for the physical and electrical exper- iments that she
            and Veratti began to do at home. Still convinced that her
            situation was not all that it could be, Bassi gradually began to
            accelerate attempts to increase her responsibilities at the
            university and the Institute, as her circle of patrons grew.
