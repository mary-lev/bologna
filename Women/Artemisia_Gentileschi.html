            Artemisia Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting*

          <p>
            In her Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting, <span class="person"
            data-person-id="person_1"> Artemisia
            Gentileschi </span>(1593-ca. 1652) made an audacious claim upon the core
            of artistic tradition, to create an entirely new image that was
            quite literally unavailable to any male artist. Her apparently
            modest self-image was, moreover, a sophisticated commentary upon a
            central philosophical issue of later Renaissance art theory,
            indicating an iden- tification with her profession on a plane of
            greater self- awareness, intellectually and culturally, than has
            previously been acknowledged.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Self-Portrait, which at present hangs in <span class="place" data-place-id="2"> Kensington
            Palace</span> (Fig. 1), Artemisia depicted herself in the act of
            painting, accompanied by several, though not all, of the
            attributes of the female personification of Painting as set forth
            in Cesare Ripa's Iconologia. These include: a golden chain around
            her neck with a pendant mask which stands for imitation, unruly
            locks of hair which symbolize the divine frenzy of the artistic
            temperament, and drappo cangiante, garments with changing colors
            which allude to the painter's skills. In 1962 <span class="person" data-person-id="person_2"> Michael Levey</span>
            confirmed the identity of the artist through a comparison with
            other seventeenth-century images of Artemisia and connected the
            picture with Ripa's description of Pittura. Levey's interpretation of the work as a self-portrait of the artist in the
            guise of Pittura has gained general acceptance. Yet although his
            interpretation is iconographically correct, it remains
            iconologically incomplete, for the artist's unique artistic
            achievement has gone curiously unnoticed, a point best illustrated
            by Levey's remark that "the picture's real intention [might] have
            been earlier recognized if it had been painted by a man." The fact
            is, no man could have painted this particular image because by
            tradition the art of painting was symbolized by an allegorical
            female figure, and thus only a woman could identify herself with
            the personification. By joining the types of the artist portrait
            and the allegory of painting, Gentileschi managed to unite in a
            single image two themes that male artists had been obliged to
            treat separately, even though these themes often carried the same
            basic message. A brief look at some concerns reflected in
            pictorial treatments of these two themes will shed light upon the
            dilemma faced by male ar- tists who had to keep them separate. It
            will also clarify for us Artemisia's own intention in this work
            and, more generally, her ideas on the art of painting
          </p>
          <p>
            Pittura, or the allegorical representation of the art of painting
            as a female figure, made her appearance in Italian art sometime in
            the first half of the sixteenth century, along with the equally
            new female personifications of sculpture and architecture. <span class="person" data-person-id="person_3"> Vasari </span>
            was the first artist to make systematic use of female
            personifications of the arts. We find them in the decorations of
            his house at Arezzo (Fig. 2), in those for his house in Florence
            (Fig. 6), and on the frames of the individual artist portraits
            that head the chapters of the Vite.5 The earliest
            sixteenth-century image of Pittura that I know was painted by
            Vasari in 1542, in the Stanza della Fama of his Arezzo house,
            along with images of Scultura, Architettura, and Poesia. Each is
            shown as an isolated female figure, seated and seen in profile,
            engaged in practicing the art she symbolizes. Vasari's archetypal
            Pittura is closely echoed in the mid-sixteenth-century engraving representing Pittura by Bartolommeo Passerotti
            (Fig. 3), and she appears in art with increasing frequency in the
            later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries.

          <p>The sixteenth-century creation of a noble personifica- tion for
            the art of painting constituted a kind of status symbol for that art, indicating the moment of its social and cultural arrival. In
            the Middle Ages, painting, sculpture, and architecture had not
            been included among the Liberal Arts. The Trivium (Dialectic,
            Rhetoric, and Grammar) and the Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry,
            Music, and Astrology) were established as the canonic seven arts
            in the fifth-century allegorical treatise of Martianus Capella,
            and in manuscripts and in sculptural cycles they were usually
            depicted as female figures, following the Roman tradition of
            allegorical personification, although the artes liberales
            themselves were not personified in antiquity. Painting and
            Sculpture were occasionally included in Liberal Arts cycles on the
            porches of medieval cathedrals, specifically those of Sens, Laon,
            and Chartres (north), and on the Florentine Campanile. Invariably
            in these last in- stances, however, the personifying figure for
            Painting or Sculpture is not female but male, even when, as at
            Laon (Fig. 4), all of the other arts are shown as women. The dis-
            tinction is significant. These figures do not represent the Fine
            Arts, as has been suggested, since the Fine Arts did not yet exist
            as a concept, but rather the Mechanical Arts, or what would later
            be called the crafts. In contrast to their female neighbors, the
            male figures who stand for the guild-controlled crafts of painting
            and sculpture are not really personifications; rather, they
            represent artisans, And this in turn reflects the status of these
            arts. Painting was not yet conceived as an activity whose
            practical aspect was subordinate to an intellectual or spiritually
            significant dimension, and thus it was not yet considered worthy
            of personification as an abstract entity, even though its progress
            toward that level was indicated by its occasional inclusion in
            medieval Liberal Art cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the fifteenth century, the seven Liberal Arts were raised to
            ten with the addition of Poetry, Philosophy, and Theology, as can
            be seen in the Tarocchi engravings, published in the 1460's, and
            also on<span class="place" data-place-id="3"> Pollaiuolo's Tomb</span> of Sixtus IV in the Vatican, of around
            1490, where Poetry was replaced by Perspective. Painting and
            Sculpture were still not included among the Liberal Arts,'2
            despite the earlier efforts of Ghiberti, Alberti, and the
            humanists to secure the position of these arts as noble
            pursuits.'3 The inferior position of Painting in the quattrocento,
            both in the intellectual order and in the popular imagination, is
            documented graphically in the scheme of the Tarocchi engravings,
            with its fixed sequence of levels of being and 12. human
            practitioners of the activities to which they refer. A of value.'4
            In the hierarchy of the Tarocchi, Painting is not included among
            the Liberal Arts; indeed, the Artisan (Fig.5) appears in the very
            lowest category, the so called conditions of Man, where he is
            superior only to the Servant. The Conditions of Man, in turn, is
            separated from the third highest category, the Liberal Arts, by
            the inter- mediate class of Apollo and the Nine Muses, who also
            symbolize the arts, but, again, not the visual arts.'s The
            structure of the Tarocchi vividly illustrates the tradition
            Laelonardo's famous argument for the inclusion of position of the
            arts of painting and sculpture in thepasinoctinalg (though not
            sculpture) among the Liberal Arts on order, before they joined the
            Liberal Arts in the earlyacscixo-unt of its genesis in the
            imagination need not be teenth century as a consequence of the
            successful efforts of leonardo and Michelangelo to elevate them
            from manual to intellectual activities.

          <p>Laelonardo's famous argument for the inclusion of painting (though
            not sculpture) among the Liberal Arts on account of its ts genesis
            in the imagination need not to be recounted here. Less familiar is
            one practical result of the acceptance of Leonardo's point of
          view: only when the art of painting was understood to involove
          inspiration and to result in a higher order of creation that the
          craftsman's product did it become appropriate to symbolize the art
          with an allegorical figure. It must remain an open question how
          female personifications originally came into being, yet on an
          expressive level a female personification for Pittura could
          usefully signal, through the very unusualness of her connection
          with an activity largely practiced by men, that she stood for Art,
          an abstract essence superior to the mere existence of artists.
          Thus she could assist in conveying the concept that art was
          separate from the manual labor connected with its making. It may
          be more than coincidence, then, that Vasari’s images of Pittura
          and Scultura at Arezzo, apparently the first to present these arts
          as allegorical female figures, should have been created two years
          after the celebrated motu proprio of Paul III, which officially
          declared sculpture to be a free art, exempt from the jurisdiction
          of guilds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pictorial elevation of the position of art above that of
            individual artists held immediate advantages for artists
            themselves who, in enlightened self-interest, sought to raise the
            status of their profession. As Tolnay has pointed out,18 the
            theoretical separation between the fine and the mechanical arts
            during the Renaissance was intimately bound up with the social
            separation between artist and artisan. The social problems posed
            for the later sixteenth-century Florentine artist by the
            association with manual arts that still attached to him, despite
            the personal attainments of Leonardo and Michelangelo, and the
            theoretical defenses developed by artists to combat this stigma
            have been extensively described in Blunt’s classic account.19
            Similarly, Pevsner has definitively characterized the official
            formation of the Florentine Academy in 1563 as the outcome of a
            series of efforts by artists to raise their own social status by
            creating a new organizational structure that would effectively
            free them from their dependence on individual guilds, and from an
            essentially medieval system that still lingered in Florence.20 The
            inevitable consequence of these concerns and efforts, an aspect
            that has received somewhat less focused art-historical attention,
            was that art itself was drawn into the service of propaganda, for
            the greater glory not of God, but of art and artists. It was
            surely for this purpose that Vasari created, shortly after 1561,
            about the time that the Academy was founded, a much fuller-blown
            Allegory of the Arts in his painted decoration for a room in his
            house in Florence. In this cycle, Vasari alternated
            personifications of the arts with narrative scenes from the life
            of Apelles, and added a row of portraits of famous painters along
            the tops of the walls (Fig. 6).21 The campaign to elevate the
            status of art was extended to <span class="place" data-place-id="3"> Rome</span>, where the counterpart for
            Vasari’s cycle can be seen in the residence of Federico Zuccaro,
            who was the principal founder of the Accademia di S. Luca, the
            institutional successor to the Florentine Academy. Zuccaro’s
            ceiling fresco of 1598 in the <span class="place" data-place-id="4"> Palazzo Zuccaro</span> depicting the
            Apotheosis of the Artist (Fig. 7) presents an idealized male
            artist accompanied by Athena and Apollo, the protectors of the
            arts, who also serve here to sustain the allegorical mode. The
            spreading effort to propagandize on behalf of the elevated status
            of art paralleled and sometimes preceded the foundation of art
            academies, a phenomenon exemplified by a painting, Athena
            Introducing Pittura to the Liberal Arts, by <span class="person" data-person-id="person_4"> Hans von Aachen </span> (Fig.
            8), executed in Cologne around the turn of the seventeenth
            century.”3 In this work, as in the Italian examples, the
            glorification of art is coupled with enhancement of the social
            position of the artist through the use of personifications,
            generally female, to set the narrative on an ideal plane.</p>

            Another mode of propagandizing for the status of art, and the
            second thematic tradition to be examined here, was
            self-portraiture in which the artist’s personal status as a
            gentleman was emphasized. Self-portraits such as that by <span class="person" data-person-id="person_5"> Antonio
            Moro </span> in the Uffizi (Fig. 9) in which the artist stands before his
            easel, holding palette, brushes, and mahlstick, yet with the
            menial implications of these tools offset by his fine clothes and
            by the attachment to the blank canvas of a poem written in Greek,
            were clearly intended to place the painter among the learned and
            to differentiate him from the mere artisan. An even more pointed
            expression of the social prestige of the artist can

          <p>be found in
          the numerous self-portraits of the sixteenth and seventeenth
          centuries that depict the artist wearing a golden chain, a
          reminder of the rank conferred upon him by a ruler. Perhaps the
          noblest example of this genre is <span class="person" data-person-id="person_6"> Titian’s </span> Self-Portrait of ca.
          1550 in <span class="place" data-place-id="5"> Berlin </span> (Fig. 10), which shows the painter wearing the
          tokens of rank given him twice by the <span class="person" data-person-id="person_7"> Emperor Charles V</span>. Such an
          expression of the social exchange between ruler and artist, and of
          their comparable prestige, had as its original model the
          relationship between Alexander the Great and Apelles, symbolized
          in the story of Alexander’s gift to the artist of Campaspe, the
          Emperor’s favorite mistress and the painter’s model. This legend
          became a popular theme in its own right in Renaissance art, as
          well as a metaphor for the exalted status of painting, a
          development that is illustrated in a print designed by the
          seventeenth-century French artist <span class="person" data-person-id="person_8"> Sebastien Bourdon </span> (Fig. 11), in
          which the Apelles and Alexander theme is used to symbolize the art
          of painting, as its label PICTURA clearly shows.
          </p>
          <p>
            As these examples demonstrate, the modes of expressing the
            nobility of the art of painting and the dignity of the artist
            proliferated in the Renaissance. Unfortunately for artists,
            however, each of the modes carried certain inherent disadvantages.
            In the first place, indirect allegorical expression, whether
            through the personification of Pittura or the legend of Apelles,
            did not permit the painter to enhance directly his own personal
            status by the image he had created unless, like Vasari or Zuccaro,
            he placed it on the walls of his own house. On the other hand, a
            self-portrait that included a badge of social distinction like the
            golden chain did not make immediately clear that the sitter was an
            artist unless he was already famous enough to be recognized on
            sight, since other kinds of noblemen were awarded golden chains
            and medallions by princes and rulers. Yet if the artist resorted
            to including studio paraphernalia in the picture, he risked
            evoking the very association with manual labor that he sought to
            escape, no matter how fine his clothes; and the finer the clothes,
            the more out of place he looked in the studio, as a Northern
            example reveals (Fig. 12). In short, whereas the inclusion of
            artists’ attributes tended to undermine the message that art was a
            noble occupation, the use of an allegorical personification tended
            to exclude portrayal of the individual artist
          </p>
          <p>
            Baccio Bandinelli stands out in the sixteenth century as one
            artist who was able effectively to convert the image of the
            artist’s studio into a metaphor for art itself in its higher,
            unmechanical aspects. The engraving of 1531 by Agostino Veneziano
            of Bandinelli’s " academy" (Fig. 13), and a counterpart engraved
            some twenty years later by Aenea Vico, are both presumed to follow
            Bandinelli’s own designs. These prints illustrate yet another way
            that the artist might attest the noble and intellectual character
            of his profession, by showing the workshop as a place where the
            arts were debated and compared as well as practiced.30 This idea
            is expanded upon in an early seventeenth-century engraving by P.
            F. Alberti that depicts an academy of painters, as the inscription
            states (Fig. 14), whose specific groupings and spirit of
            analytical discourse intentionally recall Raphael’s School of
            Athens.31 That august association can only have boosted the image
            of the arts, yet in both these examples the connection of the
            artist-author with the academy he depicted remains tenuous,
            depending for the Bandinelli upon the inscription alone. It is
            perhaps in some measure indicative of a lingering problem for the
            artist who sought to associate himself with the rising status of
            his profession that one of the culminating examples of this
            workshop/academy tradition, Pietro Testa’s engraving of the early
            1640’s, the Liceo della pittura (Fig. 15), contains a poignant
            personal emblem, a snake and stone in the lower right corner, to
            stand for Testa himself, who as a living artist had no place in
            the ensemble of ideal characters he had created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ironically, then, although the idea of painting as a noble pursuit
            had acute personal relevance for every practicing artist of the
            sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, direct personal
            identification with the elevated status of art was only possible
            for the male artist through indirect and sometimes very awkward
            combinations of attributes. Two final examples may help to confirm
            this point. In one of several self-portraits that include his
            golden chain (Fig. 16), Van Dyck displays his trophy with naive
            pride, at the same time pointing very self-consciously to a giant
            sunflower. Both attributes symbolize the art of painting, and form
            a composite expression of the artist’s devotion to “his King, to
            God and to the art of painting.” An equally ingenious though
            aesthetically deficient solution was offered by G. D. Cerrini
            (Fig. 17), who, in a painting of the mid-seventeenth century,
            combined the Allegory of Painting with a self-image by having the
            female personification hold forth a portrait of the artist.24
            When, in his Self-Portrait of 1650, Poussin reversed this
            arrangement, positioning himself as the living character in the
            center and alluding to Pittura in a painted image behind,35 he
            created what is surely a superior work of art, and a more
            naturalistically plausible combination of artist and allegory, yet
            these entities still, necessarily, remain separate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prevalence of combined images such as these illustrates a
            continuing desire on the part of artists to link themselves with
            the elevated concept of art, yet in the very period when it
            mattered most, the allegorical conventions employed to promote
            that concept proved resistant to the inclusion of the living
            artist. Self-portraits might contain allusions to art, allegories
            of the arts might stand next to artists’ portraits, Apelles or
            Minerva might be invoked, yet all possible forms of joining the
            two components were inevitably elliptical. And although elliptical
            or proliferated forms of expression, mixing ideal and real, were
            compatible with the tastes of maniera artists, the general
            preference in the seventeenth century for rendering complex
            abstract ideas sensate and clear through simple, cohesive images
            invited a more direct and naturalistic form of combining pittore
            with Pittura.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these terms, Artemisia Gentileschi’s Self-Portrait as La
            Pittura may be considered the quintessential Baroque version of
            the theme of the Allegory of Painting. In Artemisia’s radically
            simplified picture, by contrast with every other example here
            discussed, the artist emerges forcefully as the living embodiment
            of the allegory. Here, painter, model, and concept are one and the
            same, and the environment of the artist’s studio is evoked by the
            barest of means. Unselfconsciously engaged in the act of painting,
            the artist appears oblivious of the golden chain that has slipped
            aside on her breast, as if to indicate that the chain is hers by
            natural right, as an attribute of the personification whose
            identity she assumes. Similarly, the unruly locks of her hair are
            more than a symbolic reference to inspiration, as Ripa had it;
            they suggest, in this context of concrete naturalism, the
            painter’s guileless indifference to personal appearance while
            caught up in the heat of work, a state of mind that contrasts
            sharply with that of contemporary male artists whose
            self-portraits indicate their efforts to look like gentlemen.
            Because of her identity as a woman, Artemisia was in a position to
            take creative advantage of the allegorical tradition, and to make
            a statement that was at once more humble and more profound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every writer on Artemisia’s Self-Portrait has suggested that the
            picture’s subject, dependent as it is upon Ripa, must have been
            dictated to the artist by a learned patron like Cassiano dal
            Pozzo.36 There is no evidence, however, that the painting was ever
            part of Cassiano’s collection (see Appendix), and since it was not
            painted for any other known patron, this proposal is gratuitous.
            We must resist the notion that a painting that draws upon Ripa’s
            Iconologia necessarily displays a scholar’s erudition. Although
            Ripa composed the Iconologia as an academician interested in the
            complex literary and artistic strands that made up the composite
            images,” many artists subsequently consulted the book for the
            purpose of creating broadly comprehensible images, not for the
            sake of arcane or erudite allusions. Moreover, a close study of
            Artemisia’s painting in relation to Ripa’s description of Pittura
            reveals that the artist made purposeful and selective use of her
            text, extracting from it for emphasis precisely those features
            which were of greatest philosophical interest to artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ripa had called, for example, for Pittura’s dress to be of drappo
            cangiante, a phrase that can be traced to Lomazzo, who in his
            treatise of 1584 describes it as a virtuoso technique practiced by
            painters of his day to demonstrate their skill in handling
            color.38 To play the changes, Lomazzo explains, an artist painted
            a passage of cloth with one color in the lights and a different
            hue in the shadows. As Artemisia runs magnificent violets and
            greens through the cloth of the sleeves, she demonstrates a
            knowledge of the technique as well as her own ability to handle
            color with skill and flourish. Yet on a more subtle level, she
            develops rich, carefully adjusted color relationships throughout
            the painting, sustaining the dominant red-brown of the background
            in the bodice, harmoniously balanced with the dark green of the
            blouse and the blue-violet highlights of the sleeves; she
            modulates flesh to white highlights to establish spatial planes
            with great precision, and she recapitulates the color scheme of
            the painting in the five patches of color on her palette. The
            color changes employed in the Self-Portrait are not simply
            embellishments added to make it conform to an iconographic
            specification, but, rather, they reflect Artemisia’s use of Ripa’s
            suggestive phrase as an opportunity to display, through her own
            interest in and command of color, the technical skill appropriate
            to Pittura herself, and perhaps even to take a position as well on
            a continuing controversy of art theory, aligning herself as she
            does with colore over disegno.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a theoretical vein quite contrary to Artemisia’s expressive
            emphasis, Ripa also stipulated that Pittura wear a long dress
            covering her feet, in order to establish a metaphorical
            relationship between the covered female body and the ideal
            proportions of painting, set down in the underdrawing but
            disguised in the final work, when the color — the clothing, as it
            were — is added. In this formulation, Ripa followed a set analogy
            between female beauty and perfection of proportions that
            frequently appeared in sixteenth-century Italian theoretical
            treatises, in which, as Elizabeth Cropper has shown, female beauty
            served as a metaphor for the perfection of urns, columns, and even
            art itself.40 Gentileschi, however, disregards this focus upon
            disegno and proportionate anatomical form as the essence of
            painting. Significantly, she ignores Ripa’s overt suggestion that
            she convert the female image into a vehicle for a rhetorical
            conceit. Leaving out the skirt and feet altogether, she places
            herself in a foreshortened, transitory, and active pose that
            prevents the viewer's discovering conventional beauty, symmetry,
            proportion or even the arched eyebrows that Ripa had emphatically
            specified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the entry on Pittura, Ripa carefully interweaves the
            themes of the pure intellectual beauty of painting and the
            physical beauty of women, in order to reinforce the cerebral, and
            therefore noble, character of the art of painting. In this, he
            adopts the device of the Mannerist painters, namely, the creation
            of a formula by which women’s bodies stand for men’s minds. Women,
            in this conception, do not share in the cerebral bounty of the art
            they symbolize. The misogynist basis of the lofty theme sounded by
            Ripa is revealed in a satirical Italian print of the seventeenth
            century, a woodcut that illustrates a popular maxim (Fig. 18).
            " Women,” the maxim asserts, “often have long dresses and short
            intellects."42 This particular misogynist conception can be
            traced as far back as the Rig Veda ("The mind of woman brooks not
            discipline. Her intellect has little weight.")43 and as far
            forward, in the Gentileschi literature alone, as Longhi’s
            appraisal of 1916 that she was “una pittrice di razza,
            manualmente; come intelletto soltanto inferiore; anche a suo
            padre."44 Although contemporary judgments of Artemisia’s
            intellectual capacities have not survived, we do find in the
            artist's correspondence occasional expressions of a heightened
            sensitivity to conventional views of woman’s ability. Writing in
            1649 to her Sicilian patron Don Antonio Ruffo, she described to
            him some of her forthcoming paintings, concluding defiantly: ‘And
            this will show your Lordship what a woman can do."45 In another
            letter written to Ruffo in the same year, Artemisia remarked
            expansively, “You will find the spirit of Caesar in this soul of a
            woman.” 46 In this statement, the artist’s play on words (Caesar’s
            animo, her anima) serves to underscore the gender difference that
            makes her claim unorthodox. Yet the claim itself boldly transcends
            sex differences, for she applies to herself a literary formula
            that was typically used to characterize important men in the
            Renaissance, in which the contemporary figure is compared to
            Alexander the Great, Caesar, or another antique luminary. Ambition
            could not have been made of sterner stuff.
