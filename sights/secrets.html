          <p>A Journey Through the Seven Secrets of Bologna</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Which are the Seven Secrets of Bologna?</h3>
          <p>The Seven Secrets of Bologna are a fascinating attraction you cannot miss that makes this city unique.</p>
          <p>In this article you will find a guide through the Seven Secrets of Bologna: little Venice, an unusual
            telephone, the three arrows on the ceiling, the broken vase on top of the Asinelli Tower, a particular
            inscription, the oldest desk in Bologna and the finger of the statue of Neptune. Let’s find it out!</p>
          <h3>1. Little Venice</h3>
          <p>In St. Piella, in the heart of Bologna, there is a small window through which you can admire a unique view:
            Little Venice, overlooking the Moline canal (dating back to the XII century, 1100 a.d.), a small stream that
            winds through the picturesque houses of the street.</p>
          <p>Few people know that, in the past, Bologna was a city crossed by a lot of watercourses used for merchant
            shipping.</p>
          <p>Little Venice is one of the most romantic spots in the city: the hearts drawn on the window, the locks and
            love phrases written on the wall make this place a perfect spot for lovers!</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/venice.jpeg" /></p>
          <h3>2. An unusual telephone</h3>
          <p>Under the so-called Voltone del Podestà, in Piazza Maggiore, it is no wonder to find people whispering,
            facing the four corners of the Torre dell’Arengo: it is the oldest “wireless phone”, another one of the
            Seven Secrets of Bologna.</p>
          <p>In the past, this place was used for hangings (looking up you can still see the original beams) visible
            also from Piazza Maggiore. Later on, the Voltone del Podestà became a channel of communication, thanks to
            which the sick of plague and leprosy could confess without infecting the priests.</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/telephone.jpeg" /></p>
          <p>In fact, the Palazzo del Podestà has a very peculiar architectural structure, thanks to which, positioning
            yourself in opposite corners, you can hear clearly what it is said from the other side. Its cross vault
            allows the sound to propagate from one side to the other. Seeing is believing!</p>
          <p>In the heart of Piazza Maggiore you can not fail to notice the majesty of the Basilica of San Petronio, the
            distinctive symbol of Bologna. In addition, a few steps from this, there is also the area of the
            Quadrilatero: a set of streets with shops, fish shops and taverns where you can taste the typical cuisine of
            Bologna, such as egg pasta from the sfogline!</p>
          <h3>3. The three arrows on the ceiling</h3>
          <p>At the entrance of Corte Isolani, in Strada Maggiore, you can discover another one of the Seven Secrets of
            Bologna: the three arrows stuck in the ceiling of the portico.</p>
          <p>Legend says that some murderers, willing to kill a young man, were distracted by a naked woman at the
            window, making them miss their shot. Their attack failed, but the three arrows are still in the wood today
            and they have become a fun curiosity.</p>
          <p>The truth is that, thanks to Alfonso Rubbiani and Guido Zucchini (historians and restorers), the three
            arrows were set in the ceiling as a joke during the restoration of the house. They are made of cane and
            cardboard.</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/arrows.jpeg" /></p>
          <p>A stone’s throw from Corte Isolani, there is Piazza Santo Stefano: come with us to discover the stories and
            legends behind the Complex of the Seven Churches. This, also known as the Basilica of Santo Stefano,
            preserves inside the Crypt of Santo Stefano. A magical place full of history!</p>
          <h3>4. The broken vase on top of the Asinelli Tower</h3>
          <p>Located at the bottom of St. Rizzoli, crossing St. Zamboni and Strada Maggiore, the Asinelli Tower is one
            of the symbolic monuments of Bologna. After a strenuous climb to the top, besides the breathtaking view, you
            can find another one of the Seven Secrets of Bologna: the broken vase.</p>
          <p>The ceramic vase would represent the qualities of the citizens of Bologna in resolving conflicts
            peacefully, but its existence is related to a mystery. It is a secret within a secret: in fact, it is not
            known why or how long this vase has been placed there and not even if it is really there!</p>
          <p>It has become a real challenge to find the broken vase, but even if your hunt fails, you can always admire
            the incredible view over the whole city.</p>
          <p>For the most superstitious ones, it should be remembered that the legend advises students not to go up,
            because it could extend their graduation time or even prevent it.</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/asinelly.jpeg" /></p>
          <p>Do you want to discover more curiosities about the Asinelli Tower? Do not miss the article Myths and
            curiosities of the two towers of Bologna: Garisenda and Asinelli.</p>
          <h3>5. A particular inscription</h3>
          <p>Walking through the porticoes of Bologna, at the beginning of St. Indipendenza, you can find another one of
            the Seven Secrets of Bologna. The inscription says Panis vita, canabis protectio, vinum laetitia, literally
            “bread is life, cannabis is protection, wine is joy”. </p>
          <p>Lots of assumptions have been made about the actual meaning of this sentence, there are those who say that
            it refers to the healing effects of cannabis or its psychotropic effects. However, the hypothesis that seems
            more correct is that this writing is connected to the flourishing hemp trade that took place in Bologna in
            the past; protection should be understood in the sense of the economic benefit gained by the city.</p>
          <p>Also in Via Indipendenza, you can not miss the magnificent Saint Peter’s Cathedral: do not miss it and go
            discover its history!</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/canabis.jpeg" /></p>
          <h3>6. The oldest desk in Bologna</h3>
          <p>Another one of the Seven Secrets of Bologna is the inscription located at Palazzo Poggi, in St. Zamboni 33.
          </p>
          <p>On one of the desks of the headquarters of the University of Bologna you can find the inscription “Panum
            resis”, which means that culture is at the basis of everything.</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/desk.jpeg" /></p>
          <p>This phrase fits perfectly with the spirit of Bologna: in fact, the Alma Mater Studiorum is the oldest
            University in the world, it has always been a symbol of excellence, to the point of earning the city the
            name “La Dotta” (literally “The Duct”).</p>
          <h3>7. Neptune’s finger</h3>
          <p>The Fountain of Neptune (called in dialect “al Żigànt”, or the giant) is located in Piazza del Nettuno just
            behind Piazza Maggiore and it is the last one of the Seven Secrets of Bologna.</p>
          <p>The statue of Neptune was built in 1565 a.d. and it hides an optical effect created by the Flemish sculptor
            Jean de Boulogne (also known as Giambologna) to circumvent the limits imposed by the Church in the
            representation of nudity.</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/secrets/neptune.jpeg" /></p>
          <p>In fact, if you look at the statue of Neptune from a specific angle (near the staircase in front of
            Salaborsa there is a darker tile called the Stone of Shame), Neptune’s finger gives the impression of being
            on erection.</p>
          <p>It is no wonder to find many tourists in Piazza del Nettuno looking at the statue from the strangest
            angles: they are admiring one of the Seven Secrets of Bologna! If you want to know more, do not miss the
            article One more reason to visit Bologna: the fountain of Neptune. </p>
