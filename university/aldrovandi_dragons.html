            <h2>The Dragon of Bologna</h2>
            <p class="author">Dr. Elizabethanne Boran, Librarian of the Edward Worth Library, Dublin</p>
            <p>One of Ulisse Aldrovandi’s most treasured exhibits was the ‘Dragon of Bologna’, a specimen which was
              reputed to have been killed in 1572 and which Aldrovandi later exhibited in his public museum. He
              naturally
              included it in his book on the history of serpents and dragons and it has attracted attention ever since
              from scholars who have sought to identify what type of animal the ‘Dragon of Bologna’ was and what its
              appearance signified.</p>
            <p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/Fig.1.Aldrovandi_v.7_p.404.jpg" /></p>
            <p class="image-note">The ‘Dragon of Bologna’ in Ulisse Aldrovandi, <em>Serpentum, et draconum historiæ
                libri duo </em>(Bologna,
              1640), p. 404.</p>
            <p>Aldrovandi presents two different types of evidence: a description of the dragon and two images, one of
              which we see here and another, in colour and similar, in his <em>Tavole di animali</em> (a work not in the
              Worth Library but available online). His description and images provide vital clues as to the real origin
              of
              the ‘Dragon of Bologna’ – and to the popularity of dragons in early modern museums. Since we know that
              Aldrovandi insisted on pictorial accuracy we can be fairly sure that his representation of the ‘Dragon of
              Bologna’ was a faithful representation.</p>
            <p>However, as Phil Senter, LaRhonda C. Hill and Brandon J. Moton have convincingly argued, though the image
              might be faithful, the object itself was a fake
              <span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="top"
                title="Phil Senter, La Rhonda C Hill and Brandon J. Moton, Solution to a 440-year-old Zoological Mystery: The Case of Aldrovandi's Dragon, <em>Annals of Science</em>, 70: 4 (2013), 531-537."><strong>[1].</strong></span>
              By analysing the images and Aldrovandi’s detailed description Senter et al. have drawn attention to the
              following parts of
              the dragon:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The fore and hind parts of the dragon resemble those of a snake, particularly the grass snake
                (<em>Natrix natrix</em>).</li>
              <li>The middle section, much enlarged, could easily have been distended and they propose that the middle
                section of the animal included another scaly animal – in this case the European perch (<em>Perca
                  fluviatilis</em>), a native Italian freshwater fish which had green scales (as Aldrovandi describes) –
                although other possible contenders are the common carp or the goldfish.</li>
              <li>Finally, the two front legs, which are also described as being covered in scales, resemble the
                forelimbs
                of another common animal found in Italy, the common toad (<em>Bufo bufo</em>).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>They conclude that ‘The dragon of Bologna, described by Ulisse Aldrovandi, was a grass snake (<em>Natrix
                natrix</em>) to which was added the torso of a fish and the forelimbs of a common toad (<em>Bufo
                bufo</em>)’. <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="top" title="Ibid., 536."
                class="footnote"><strong>[2]</strong></span></p>
            <p>Did Aldrovandi know his ‘Dragon of Bologna’ was a fake? Almost certainly, for he was aware of, and drew
              attention to, other fakes. Senter et al. suggest that, in his description, Aldrovandi in fact hinted that
              the ‘Dragon of Bologna’ was not all it purported to be – his commentary likened the various parts of the
              dragon to the three animals from which it was composed and he included information which, as a naturalist,
              he knew to be highly dubious<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                data-placement="top" title="Ibid."><strong>[3].</strong></span></p>
            <p>Why then did Aldrovandi include it in his museum? He wouldn’t have been the first to resort to creating a
              fake dragon for propaganda effect (see the example of the Barberini dragon on the <a
                href="https://mythicalcreatures.edwardworthlibrary.ie/dragons/winged-dragon/">winged dragons</a>
              page), but it is unlikely that he was the fabricator of this particular hoax. However, although he
              probably
              hadn’t created it himself he would have been conscious that the inclusion of the creature in his museum
              could be a marketing bonanza. He was certainly interested in using the ‘Dragon of Bologna’ for his own
              ends
              and soon began work on his book on serpents and dragons. Noting that reports on the dragon spread widely,
              Paula Findlen argues that Aldrovandi was keen to maximise the discovery to his own advantage and he
              clearly
              used the object to draw attention to his museum.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip"
                data-html="true" data-placement="top"
                title="Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museum, Collecting, and
                Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (University of California Press, 1994), p. 18."><strong>[4]</strong></span> However, he had
              to
              be careful because, while the ‘Dragon of Bologna’ might represent an enormous marketing opportunity, it
              also
              had attendant risks since it was not just of zoological interest but could also involve him in a political
              scandal.</p>
            <p>The ‘Dragon of Bologna’ had appeared on 13 May 1572, the same day that a citizen of the city had become
              pope. <span class="person" data-person-id="1">Ugo Buoncompagni</span>’s (1502-1585) elevation as
              <span class="person" data-person-id="2">Pope Gregory XIII</span> was a swift one, coming less than
              twenty-four hours after the start of the conclave. The reason for this was because Ugo had, as papal
              legate
              to <span class="person" data-person-id="3">King Philip II of Spain</span> (1527-1598), gained the
              support of the Spanish king,
              a support which greatly
              aided his elevation to the papacy. However, as the appearance of the fake dragon on 13 May 1572 at his
              home
              city demonstrates, he clearly had local enemies as it seems likely that its appearance was a deliberate
              act
              to discredit the new pope. His enemies would have been very aware of the propaganda possibilities of such
              marvels: the example of <span class="person" data-person-id="4">Martin Luther</span>’s and Philip
              Melancthon’s polemical use of the ‘papal ass’ was
              within
              living memory and provided evidence that this type of political trick could prove a potent polemical
              weapon
              against the papacy. Dragons generally had a bad press in sixteenth-century Italy &#8211; Satan was often
              depicted in dragon form &#8211; so by linking <span class="person" data-person-id="2">Gregory
                XIII</span>’s election with the appearance of a fearsome
              dragon, the conspirators could be fairly confident that their ruse would work to their political
              advantage.
              It was a cunning plan because it cleverly evoked the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boncompagni">coat of arms</a> of the new pope’s family, which
              included
              a winged dragon. Thus the appearance of the ‘Dragon of Bologna’ reinforced a link between Gregory XIII and
              a
              mythical beast considered a force of destruction.
            </p>
            <p>Aldrovandi, as a cousin of the new pope, was thus faced with a tricky situation. As Senter et al.
              suggest,
              he had a number of options: he could either publically declare it a hoax (which might have led to him
              becoming a target for the anti-Gregory XIII faction in Bologna), or he could laud it as a true dragon
              (which
              might cause political difficulties for the new pope), or he could do exactly what he did do: report on it
              by
              concentrating on the natural parts of its make-up, thus neutralizing the political sting in its tail. As
              Findlen concludes, ‘In this fashion, the naturalist turned a potentially disastrous occurrence into a
              providential act of patronage for his museum. By explaining away the serpent as an example of nature’s
              fecundity rather than a diabolical catastrophe, he diffused its saturnine implications, scientifically
              securing the foundation of the new papacy for his patrons in Rome’.<span class="footnote"
                data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="top"
                title="Ibid., p. 21."><strong>[5]</strong></span>
            </p>
            <p>Despite this his papal cousin doesn’t appear to have been particularly impressed by Aldrovandi’s efforts.
              In a letter to <span class="person" data-person-id="5">Fabio Albergati</span> (1538-1606), written
              on 20
              October 1602, Aldrovandi recounted the ultimate
              failure of his project:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Given the fact that the dragon is the coat of arms of the illustrious
              Boncompagni family, I sent to Rome a painting of the said dragon together with a relation of its
              discovery,
              and a history in five books entitled ‘Dracologia’. I visited the illustrious Cardinal of San Sisto
              [Fillippo
              Boncompagni, the pope’s nephew] when he stopped at <span class="place" data-place-id="1">Bologna</span>
              on his way to Venice. On that occasion, I
              promised to dedicate the work to him, if that would have pleased him. But I realised that he did not care
              for the work, and so I turned myself away from the enterprise<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip"
                data-html="true" data-placement="top" title="Quoted in Marco Ruffini, ‘A Dragon for the Pope: Politics and
              Emblematics at the court of Gregory XIII’, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, 54 (2009),
              94."><strong>[6].</strong></span></p>
            <p>This explains why a work which was written in 1572 to cash in on a potential market remained unpublished
              during the author’s life and would only be published in 1639, twenty-four years after his death. To make
              matters worse, by 1602 the object itself had disappeared due to curatorial neglect (or perhaps, as Ruffini
              suggests, because the original had simply disintegrated).<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip"
                data-html="true" data-placement="top" title="Ibid., p. 95, fn 40."><strong>[7]</strong></span></p>
            <p>For Gregory XIII had options too. As Ruffini points out, Gregory XIII might not have lauded the 1572
              ‘Dragon of Bologna’ but he decided to turn the Boncompagni’s coat of arms into an asset, rather than a
              liability. He deliberately chose to use a winged dragon as part of his new papal coat of arms and
              encouraged
              a re-evaluation of dragon iconography. Ruffini notes that Filippo Sega (1537-1596), a fellow Bolognese
              whose
              career had been sponsored to a great extent by Gregory XIII, wrote to Aldrovandi on 1 June 1572, that the
              ‘Dragon of Bologna’s’ appearance ‘is almost like an emblem, or an <em>impresa</em> miraculously revealed
              by
              the just God, to declare the true and perfect nature of our dragon, that today reigns and governs with
              prudence, swiftness of thought, and strength of resolution’.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip"
