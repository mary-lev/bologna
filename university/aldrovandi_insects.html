                            <p>Abstract: With his work, De animalibus insectis (1602), Ulisse Aldrovandi occupies a
                                prominent place in the history of entomology. Of particular interest in this volume are
                                the many original descriptions and woodcuts of insects. Partly due to the 'Tavole di
                                animali' [Tables of animals] − illustrations drawn and watercoloured by hand, made by
                                the author previously for the realization of the woodcuts for the printed book − some of
                                them can be identified at genus or species level. For a large number of insects,
                                Aldrovandi's descriptions and illustrations are the oldest in the en-tomological
                                literature. Three adult antlions and one adult green lacewing are recognizable in the
                                book and have already been studied; hypothetical larvae of green lacewings can be added
                                and are recorded here. Among the butterflies and moths, there is another rather
                                enigmatic insect, which could be an owlfly (ascalaphid), though there is some
                                uncertainty due to discrepancies between its colouring in the 'Tavole di animali' and
                                its description in the book. This paper deals with the possible identification of this
                                insect as an ascalaphid and outlines the origin and meaning of the term 'ascalaph'.
                                Historical preamble Despite their medium or large size and showy aspect, owlflies seem
                                to have made their first appearance rather late in entomological literature of the past
                                centuries. Insects apparently related to dragonflies or halfway between dragonflies and
                                butterflies, as in the case of the genus Libelloides Schäffer, 1763, with brightly
                                coloured wings, represented for some of the early taxonomists a puzzle for purposes of
                                classification. Proof of this is the fact that both Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his
                                Entomologia Carniolica published in 1763 and Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in
                                their anonymous work of 1775, usually known as Wiener Verzeichnis, ascribed the current
                                Libelloides macaronius and L. coccajus, described by them, to the genus Papilio
                                Linnaeus, 1758 (Letardi 1995). Not so, however, Linnaeus, who in the 1764 edition of his
                                Systema Naturae had already recognized the true affinity of such insects, placing the
                                current L. longicornis described by him in that year in his (at that time widely
                                comprehensive) genus Hemerobius and later, in the 1768 edition, improving the
                                attribution by assigning it to the genus Myrmeleon, which he instituted in the same work
                                (Pantaleoni & Loru 2018); these authors also present an overview of the 18th century
                                authors who dealt with owlflies. For the subsequent century, see the monograph by van
                                der Weele (1908: 7 ff.).</p>
                            <h3>Historical preamble</h3>
                            <p>Despite their medium or large size and showy aspect, owlflies seem to have made their
                                first appearance rather late in entomological literature of the past centuries. Insects
                                apparently related to dragonflies or halfway between dragonflies and butterflies, as in

                                for some of the early taxonomists a puzzle for purposes of classification. Proof of this
                                is the fact that both Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his Entomologia Carniolica published
                                in 1763 and Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in their anonymous work of 1775,

                                so, however, Linnaeus, who in the 1764 edition of his Systema Naturae had already
                                recognized the true affinity of such insects, placing the current L. longicornis

                            <p>As regards the 18th century, the following authors are briefly mentioned here: James
                                Petiver, who seems to have been the first, in 1711, to provide a certain illustration of
                                an
                                owlfly, the current L. macaronius (Scopoli, 1763), using the name »Smyrna Butter-bolt«
                                in his Gazophylacium (Petiverus 1711); Jacob Christian Schäffer, who in his monographic
                                study Das Zwiefalter oder Afterjungferchen, published in 1763, dealt with the
                                current L. coccajus ([Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775), calling it »Libelloides seu
                                Libellula
                                spuria« (Schäffer 1763); and Albertus Seba, who in his Locupletissimi rerum naturalium
                                thesauri accurata descriptio, published in 1765, also provided illustrations of owlflies
                                (Seba 1765).</p>
                            <p>It is therefore in the 18th century, especially the second half, that with the onset of
                                the
                                great period of systematic classification of insects that blossomed in the cultural
                                context
                                of the Enlightenment, the presence of today’s owlflies or ascalaphids appears with
                                certainty in entomological literature. These insects had apparently escaped the
                                consideration of the most eminent entomologists active in England, France and Central
                                Europe
                                in the 16th and 17th centuries, from Moufet to Ray and from Réaumur to Roesel von
                                Rosenhof. Perhaps this was due to the distribution in Europe of owlflies being mostly to
                                the south, in the northern Mediterranean region, and also because they are often
                                localized or rare insects, whose biology and holometabolic development were still
                                unknown
                                at that time.</p>
                            <p>It is noteworthy, therefore, that Aldrovandi, an Italian author active in the second half
                                of the 16th and the very early 17th century, left an indication in his work of a
                                hypothetical
                                owlfly, even if the elements provided by him give rise to some uncertainty. The
                                following
                                notes aim to focus principally on this particular aspect of his work, a very small
                                tessera
                                in the large mosaic of the encyclopaedic production of this giant in the history of
                                natural sciences and forerunner in the systematic study of insects; but a tessera
                                perhaps of
                                some interest for the history of neuropterology</p>
                            <h3>Ulisse Aldrovandi and his neuropterans</h3>
                            <p>Ulisse Aldrovandi (Bologna 1522–1605; Fig. 1) is an important representative of
                                scientific humanism of the late Renaissance and one of the greatest naturalists of the
                                16th
                                century. He was a professor at the University of Bologna for many years and began
                                publishing his monumental work only at the age of 77 (Berlese 1909; Bodenheimer
                                1928–29; Montalenti 1978; Nicoli Aldini 2005). The many volumes of Aldrovandi’s
                                manuscripts and original watercolour illustrations of naturalistic subjects pertinent to
                                his observations, dating back to the second half of the 16th century and preserved in
                                the
                                University Library of Bologna (BUB 2019), are a precious reference source for a deeper
                                analysis of his way of thinking and working (Alessandrini & Ceragato 2007; Nicoli
                                Aldini 2007, 2008). His work De animalibus insectis libri septem (Aldrovandus 1602;
                                Fig. 2) is the first printed book dedicated entirely to insects and stands out in the
                                history of entomology; after the editio princeps published in 1602, there were several
                                posthumous editions: Frankfurt, 1618, 1623; Bologna 1620, 1634, 1638–44 (Montalenti
                                1978), testifying to its quality, novelty, and the interest it aroused for posterity. It
                                is in
                                large part an ample and accurate compilation, a true mine of quotations and notions
                                taken from previous authors, especially from classical antiquity, but also containing a
                                classification schema, many original observations and a large number of woodcuts of
                                insects, almost all present in Italy and observed by the author. A certain number of
                                these
                                woodcuts and descriptions are identifiable today at genus or species level, thanks
                                partly to the series of ‘Tavole di animali’ [Tables of animals] drawn and watercoloured
                                by
                                hand, which the author had prepared previously for the future realization of the
                                woodcuts for his zoological books (BUB, Tavole acquerellate di Ulisse Aldrovandi).
                                However,
                                the woodcuts of insects in the printed book are more numerous than the watercolours
                                of insects in the Tables. For a good number of genera or species of insects,
                                Aldrovandi’s
                                descriptions and illustrations are the oldest in entomological literature.</p>

                                (Chrysopidae) and three different antlions (Myrmeleontidae) have been briefly treated
                                (Aspöck & Aspöck 2007; Nicoli Aldini 2007), but only one of the latter is identifiable
                                with certainty at genus level, thanks above all to the ‘Tavole di animali’, in which

                                is also an antlion larva not included in the printed work (Nicoli Aldini 2007).
                                Aldrovandi treated adult antlions, dragonflies and damselflies together, mixing them
                                under
                                the Latin name of ‘Perlae’.</p>
                            <p>For a more complete analysis of Aldrovandi’s neuropterological work, it should be
                                added that in the printed book there are also two woodcuts of a hypothetical
                                debriscarrying larva of a green lacewing (Chrysopidae), drawn respectively with and
                                without
                                debris and placed among the insects named (in the singular) ‘Xylophthoros’ or
                                ‘Ligniperda’ or ‘Phryganium’, i.e., larvae of the current caddis-flies and psychid moths
                                provided with cases of plant material. Aldrovandi wrote: »Item [habes hic iconem]
                                alterius
                                [Xylophthori] minimi cum suis festucis, et sine festucis nimirum n. 6, et 7« [Similarly

                            <p>Bodenheimer (1928–29: II, 345) did not attempt an identification, qualifying these
                                illustrations simply as »Insekten-Larven«. The hypothesis that at least one could be a
                                debris-carrying larva of a green lacewing (e.g., a species of the current genus
                                Pseudomallada Tsukaguchi, 1995) is supported by its mouthparts which are forceps-like;
                                the
                                other larva, with similar mouthparts, but without debris and with a slender body, could
                                belong to another green lacewing genus rather than to the same debris-carrying species.
                                Aldrovandi’s neuropterans are also later considered in the work Historiae naturalis
                                de insectis libri tres, published in 1653 (first edition) by the naturalist of Scottish

                            <p>Among Aldrovandi’s butterflies and moths, there is an enigmatic insect, perhaps an
                                owlfly, although there is some uncertainty, partly due to the discrepancy between its
                                colouring as it appears in the Tables of animals, where it is referred to as »Papilio
                                subcastaneus«
                                (BUB, Tavole acquerellate di Ulisse Aldrovandi, Tavole di animali, tomo VII, c. 119;
                                Figs 4, 5) and its description in the printed book. The combination of the chromatic
                                features described, which seem only partially compatible with the current genus
                                Libelloides
                                or with other genera of owlflies, is perplexing. Bodenheimer (1928–1929: II, 340),
                                basing himself on the illustration in the printed book, qualified this insect as
                                »(Ascalaphus
                                sp.)«, the use of parentheses denoting doubt. Among the many insects treated by
                                Aldrovandi, this is only one of several insects giving rise to uncertainty regarding
                                identification. Here is Aldrovandi’s Latin description from his book, and a translation:
                            </p>
                            <p>»Insolentis profecto formae caput obtinet quinto loco pictus, a cuius lateribus duo sunt

                                with many black hairs, and another two on the front, which however are of the same
                                colour as the head – i.e., intensely red – on the sides of which there are two more
                                tubercles, black like the first mentioned. The wings sprout from the lower extremity of
                                the
                                back and they are of rather blackish colour, with golden-yellow lines and stains. The

                            <p>The watercolour of this insect (Fig. 5) and the derived woodcut in the De animalibus
                                insectis (Figs 6, 7) as for other illustrations by Aldrovandi of insects present some
                                fanciful elements, examples of artistic licence. In all likelihood, some features in the
                                picture
                                are not faithful to the model, especially as regards long legs: in the ‘Tavole di
                                animali’, and consequently in the printed book, there are various examples of genera and
                                species,
                                especially butterflies and moths, which are easily recognizable, but illustrated with
                                long
                                legs (instead of short thin legs) based on imagination rather than reality. The
                                uniformly
                                dark colour of the wings of »Papilio subcastaneus« in the same ‘Tavole’ can also be seen
                                in watercolours of other insects with membranous wings (for example, dragonflies
                                identifiable at species level, with hyaline wings), where a silvery colour was probably
                                used
                                which subsequently oxidized, becoming darker; this uniformly dark colouring of the
                                hypothetical owlfly does not, moreover, correspond to its description in the book, which
                                seems to suggest the pigmentation and wing venation of a species of Libelloides, dark
                                but
                                with golden-yellow spots and lines. The very simple “fish bone” wing veins, present in
                                the watercolour and in the woodcut, may also be due to imagination. The colour of the
                                abdomen, both in the watercolour and in the description, yellowish and red, as well as
                                the rest of the body, intensely red with some black tubercles, does not correspond with
                                the colour of a Libelloides and is rather closer to that of the current genus
                                Deleproctophylla Lefèbvre, 1842, if we refer to Italian and Mediterranean owlflies, but
                                the latter
                                genus does not coincide with other descriptive elements. The head and the thorax with
                                thick and erect black hairs, instead, are very suggestive for the attribution to a
                                Libelloides.
                                The abdominal formations could be male cerci, even though imperfectly drawn, if the
                                insect was indeed an owlfly. Was the model of the enigmatic insect perhaps a specimen
                                of Libelloides with the colour of the body (not red) altered and lightened by many years
                                of exposure to light? Or was it an immature adult, with the body incompletely pigmented?
                                Or were errors made by the author of the watercolour? It is not possible to say.</p>
                            <p>Evidence in favour of the hypothesis that the mysterious insect is in any case a
                                neuropteran is given by Aldrovandi himself further on in the same book, when he comments
                                on the woodcut of an unquestionable Palpares Rambur, 1842 (Nicoli Aldini 2007),
                                erroneously inserted in a table including locusts and mantids: »Papilionis icon est,
                                quam
                                supra dedimus inter papiliones« [It is the image of a butterfly or moth, which we have
                                provided above among them] (Aldrovandus 1602: 414 f., woodcut 5). Bodenheimer
                                (1928–29: II, 345) seemed to identify without doubt this insect as »Ascalaphus sp.«, but
                                erroneously. In fact, among Aldrovandi’s ‘Papiliones’ there is no woodcut of Palpares or
                                other current neuropterans, except the hypothetical owlfly, which also corresponds as
                                regards dimensions. In Aldrovandi’s work, there are generally no precise size
                                indications, but the figures in the tables are roughly to scale between themselves.</p>

                                hypothetic owlfly in the centre. </p>
                            <p>A different hypothesis is that proposed as definitive by Roberto A. Pantaleoni (in
                                litt.):
                                the enigmatic insect could be a male Palaeococcus Cockerell, 1894 (Homoptera,
                                Orthezioidea, Margarodidae); in Europe this genus includes one species – P. fuscipennis
                                (Burmeister, 1839) – which corresponds in shape and in the dark-grey colour of the only
                                pair
                                of wings developed (however, Aldrovandi’s insect has two pairs of wings), in the bright
                                red colour of the whole body and blackish colour of the antennae and legs, as well as in
                                the presence of dorsal reliefs on the thorax, while the antennal scapus may seem from
                                either side an anterior tubercle, and the posterior end of the abdomen has two elongated
                                red processes (cf. Gavrilov-Zimin 2018). The chromatic similarities with the watercolour
                                are undoubtedly suggestive, but the presence of only one pair of wings, the rather
                                small overall dimensions of the males of “giant scales”, slightly less than one
                                centimetre,
                                and the absence of the many erect black hairs on the head and thorax are less
                                convincing.</p>
                            <p>Uncertainty therefore prevails regarding this apparent chimera. Future careful research
                                into Aldrovandi’s entomological manuscripts may be helpful in solving this puzzle.</p>

                            <p>The illustration of this hypothetical owlfly was later (1653) reproduced by Jonston,
                                merely reporting faithfully the description provided by Aldrovandi (Jonstonus 1653:
                                56, pl. VI n. 5). </p>
                            <h3>Ascalaphids, the weight of a name</h3>
                            <p>If the insect treated by Aldrovandi was in fact an ascalaphid, it would be the earliest
                                representative of this neuropteran family in entomological literature, anticipating by
                                more than a century its unquestionable and well-known illustrations of the 18th century.
                                However, it took over a century and a half for the current term ‘ascalaph’ to appear in
                                entomological literature.</p>
                            <p>Indeed, this noun appeared scientifically thanks to Johann Christian Fabricius, who
                                in 1775 instituted the genus Ascalaphus (van der Weele 1908; Aspöck et al. 1980).
                                The Latin word derives from the ancient Greek ἀσκάλαφος (askàlaphos − sort of owl
                                or barn owl), the name used by Aristotle for an unspecified nocturnal bird of prey; but
                                Ἀσκάλαφος (Askàlaphos) is, in Greek mythology, a son of Ares, quoted in the Iliad;
                                or, according to other myths, a suitor of Helen, or a son of Acheron transformed by
                                Persephone into an owl (Bonavilla & Marchi 1819; Ferrari 1999). A particularly
                                euphonic and meaningful name, due to its double value in expressing, on the one hand,
                                similarity of the ‘face’ of these lacewings with that of the well-known nocturnal birds
                                of
                                prey and, on the other hand, in transposing mythological figures of ancient Hellas into
                                the world of insects, in the wake of Linnaeus.</p>
                            <p>Many more decades passed before Alexandre Louis Lefèbvre de Cérisy instituted the
                                family Ascalaphidae in 1842 (van der Weele 1908; Aspöck et al. 2001), and from this
                                family name sprang the more wide-ranging term ‘ascalaphid’, used in many modern
                                languages for indicating all species of this family of voracious predators, whether they
                                are on the wing during the sunniest hours of the day, or on the contrary, in common
                                with owls, have twilight or nocturnal habits.</p>
